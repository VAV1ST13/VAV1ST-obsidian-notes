# description of what it is necessary for
My hobby is exploring Metaverse platforms.
My friends and I want to hold events, events and excursions for a wide range of people (beginners) unfamiliar with VRChat.
I wanted to write down what functions are missing in VRChat so that events can be carried out much easier.

# access to the instance by code
At the moment, inviting a large group of newcomers to a certain instance involves the problem of a large number of actions that a user who is not familiar with the VRChat interface should do.

0. launch the application
1. open the menu
2. click Social
3. сlick Search
4. enter the organizer's nickname
5. choose an organizer
6. send a request to friends
7. waiting for acceptance as friends
8. click Social
9. choose an organizer
10. click Req Invite
11. waiting for a response
12. open the menu
